# Python-iOS
Running python scripts in iOS swift. Mainly trying to run **Open3D** registration on iOS.

## Notes
* `Pythonkit` works only with **macOS** and does not support **iOS** at the moment.
* `C++ API` for **Open#D** is not giving same results as `Python API` and also takes mroe `time`.
* Now looking into `**Kivy-iOS**`.
